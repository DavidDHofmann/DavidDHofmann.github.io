# Introduction
The Okavango Delta is a flood-pulse driven mosaic of patchy woodlands,
permanent swamps, and seasonally flooded grasslands that lie within the
otherwise dry and sandy Kalahari Basin. It is the world's largest inland delta,
with a catchment area that can easily be seen from space (Figure 1). The
delta's floodwaters are originating from the Angolan highlands, where water is
channeled through the Cuito and Cubango rivers into the Okavango river. The
Okavango river eventually splits into many different channels that inundate a
massive alluvial fan, covering an area between 5'000 and 15'000 km^2. Because
of the shallow gradient of the delta (1/5600 at the upper floodplains and
1/3400 at the lower floodplains) water only slowly descends from the catchment
areas in Angola into the Okavango Delta. As a result, the flood reaches its
prime extent during the peak dry season (in July or August), when local rains
have long ceased. The massive inflow of fresh-water during this otherwise dry
period allows many species to survive in this arid ecosystem and attracts
massive herds of elephants and antelopes, turning the Delta into a thriving
hotspot of biodiversity.

The Okavango Delta's flood extent is highly dynamic and drastically changes
across and within years (Figure 2). Being able to depict flood extents during
different points in time is therefore vital to better understand species
behavior and movement patterns. Thanks to data from numerous freely accessible
satellites, remote sensing opens up new avenues for rendering flood patterns of
the Okavango Delta at unprecedented spatio-temporal scales. Historically,
spatial ecologists have utilized [normalized differences
indices](https://www.indexdatabase.de/) (NDs) to remote sense various
properties of a landscape from satellite imagery. With respect to remote
sensing surface water, the normalized difference in water index (NDWI) has
proven particularly useful. However, the Okavango Delta is a more tricky case,
as areas inundated by water are often not recognizable as such. The main reason
for this is that the delta's floodwaters are incredibly shallow, such that
water is often obstructed by vegetation (e.g., tall grass). In this situation,
the NDWI tends to underestimate the true extent of the delta's flood.

```

To address this shortcoming, the [Okavango Delta Research
Institute](https://www.ori.ub.bw/services/environmental-monitoring-unit) has
developed a [remote sensing
algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243417300053?casa_token=2HoV8n0eFAsAAAAA:VLTUyhbvafjkMVNB38OjqAyagOG2WrYphQWCW5K4IseiEhU_sVx8ms3A3Mq_8uzsFBYTZ5R5sNo)
that is specifically tailored towards detecting flooded areas across the
Okavango Delta. The algorithm utilizes [MODIS
MCD43A4](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mcd43a4v061/) satellite data, which
provides updated composite imagery on an 8 daily basis. Thanks to MODIS' high
revisitation rate, these 8 daily composites are almost guaranteed to be
cloud-free, thus providing a near-continuous monitoring of the Delta. This
comes at the cost of a relatively coarse spatial resolution of 500 m.
Nevertheless, 500 m will suffice for most ecological applications.

I have repeatedly applied the algorithm developed by ORI to obtain flood maps
my own analyses of African wild dog (*Lycaon pictus*) movements across the
Delta. I therefore invested a substantial amount of time into developing an
automated workflow to generate flood maps for a desired date. The result of
these efforts is the `floodmapr` R-package, which is essentially a collection
of all necessary functions to download and process MODIS satellite data to
generate a flood map. You can access and install the package via
[Github](https://github.com/DavidDHofmann/floodmapr/tree/master).

```{r, eval=F}
devtools::install_github("DavidDHofmann/floodmapr")
```

In this blog post, I'd like to show you how to use the package and highlight
how you can easily create a flood map for the Okavango Delta for your desired
dates. While the general workflow is rather simple, I'd like to equip you with
a bit of background so you better understand what's happening "beneath the
hood".

# Mapping the Flood
The general flood mapping workflow is fairly simple:

- Download a MODIS satellite image for the desired date (`modis_download()`)
- Load the data into R (`modis_load()`)
- Ensure that we have bimodality in the reflectance properties of water vs. dryland (`modis_bimodal()`)
- Use thresholding to classify a flood map (`modis_classify()`)

Let's see how this works.

## Downloading a Satellite Image
As mentioned before, the flood mapping algorithm uses MODIS MCD43A4 data.
Consequently, we first need to download a satellite image for the date for
which we'd like to prepare a flood map. The `floodmapr` package provides the
`modis_download()` function for this purpose, which will automatically query
and download the necessary data. You cannot pick a specific area, as the entire
Delta will be mapped. Note that you'll need to setup a free create account with
[EarthData](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/) to download data.

Ok, so let's assume we want to create flood maps for the dates shown in Figures
2a and 2b. We can download satellite maps for the two dates as follows:

```{r, echo = F}
load("/home/david/ownCloud/Dokumente/Bibliothek/Wissen/R-Scripts/EarthDataLogin.rds")
```

```{r, messages = F, warnings = F}
# Load the floodmapr package
library(floodmapr)

# Download MODIS data for the two desired dates
downloaded <- modis_download(
    dates     = c("2022-09-16", "2023-03-10")
  , outdir    = tempdir()
  , tmpdir    = tempdir()
  , username  = username
  , password  = password
  , overwrite = F
  , messages  = F
)

```

The function will automatically download and preprocess the required MCD43A4
images and store them on your hard-drive. Even though only band 7 will be
needed, the function downloads all MODIS bands for completeness.

## Loading the Data into R
Once the download is finished, the function returns the paths to the downloaded
files. We'll pass the filepaths into the `modis_load()` function (which is a
wrapper for the `terra::rast()` function) to load the generated rasters into
our R-session.

```{r}
# Load the two downloaded maps into the current R-session
flood_dry <- modis_load(downloaded[1])
flood_wet <- modis_load(downloaded[2])
show(flood_dry)
show(flood_wet)
```

## Check for Bimodality
In order to run a classification (dry vs. water), the flood mapping algorithm
makes use of a set of dryland and water polygons. These are assumed to always
be in dryland or in water, respectively, and serve to "calibrate" the flood
mapping algorithm. They basically allow informing the algorithm about the
reflectance properties of dryland versus water for the given point in time (as
these may change with the seasons). However, a reliable calibration is only
possible if the two categories exhibit sufficiently distinct reflectances. To
check this, we can run a bimodality check with the `modis_bimodal()` function,
which extracts reflectance properties beneath the two categories (dryland and
water) and generates a density plot of the band 7 reflectance values. If there
are two very distinct peaks (one for dryland, one for water), we can go ahead
and safely generate a flood map. If bimodality is not given, we can still
create a flood map, yet should be more careful when using it for analyses.

```{r, echo=F, messages=F, out.width="100%", fig.cap=" a) Calibration polygons that are used to inform the algorithm about the reflecance properties of dryland vs. water. b) Shows a classified flood map."}
knitr::include_graphics("img/FloodmappingPolygons.png", error = F)
```

```{r}
# Check for bimodality
modis_bimodal(flood_dry)
modis_bimodal(flood_wet)

# Visualize the reflectance properties
modis_specs(flood_dry)
modis_specs(flood_wet)
```

In our case, it appears that only the first map is bimodal, whereas the second
is not. This can quite clearly be seen from the spectral reflectance images
that show a substantial overlap in the second case. For the sake of this
tutorial, we'll ignore the bimodality issue.

## Classifying an Image
We can now go ahead and run a classification to create a proper flood map. For
this, we use the `modis_classify()` function, which will automatically
determine a threshold to split the map into dryland and water. If the map fails
the bimodality check, we can still enforce a classification using the option
`ignore.bimodality = T`. However, this is not advised and may result in
unreliable flood maps.

```{r, echo=T, messages=F, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Classified flood maps."}
# Classify floodmaps, for now ignoring bimodality
flood_dry_class <- modis_classify(flood_dry, ignore.bimodality = T)
flood_wet_class <- modis_classify(flood_wet, ignore.bimodality = T)

# Visualize the classified maps
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(flood_dry_class, col = c("white", "cornflowerblue"), main = "Flood 2022-09-16")
plot(flood_wet_class, col = c("white", "cornflowerblue"), main = "Flood 2023-03-10")
```

# Conclusion
With the `floodmapr` package were able to generate flood maps for a couple of
dates with only few lines of code.
