<div id="what-is-it" class="section level1">
<h1>What is it?</h1>
<p>Back in the day when I studied economics, I attended a lecture in “big data
science”. Although I disliked the lecture (more precisely the lecturer), I have
to admit that it was rather informative and useful for my future career. One of
the first pieces of wisdom that our teacher equipped us with was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choose your editor with more care than you would choose your spouse because
you will continue to use the editor long after the spouse is gone.
– <cite> Some awkward professor </cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout the course of the lecture it became strikingly clear that the teacher
made this statement based on personal experience, but I still didn’t quite
understand all the fuzz about choosing a specific editor. Nevertheless, the
quote stuck with me and I eventually decided to investigate the merits and
promises from different text editors. During my odyssey through the world wide
web, I repeatedly stumbled across one specific text editor called “vim”. Vim,
formerly known as vi, is one of the most popular and powerful text editors out
there and often comes pre-installed on computers and servers. Vim does not need
a graphical user interface, but is rather executed from the terminal.</p>
<p>As you might expect from a text editor, vim allows you to open, edit, and store
any type of text or code. In this sense, vim is nothing special. However, its
power and popularity stem mainly from the thoroughly designed keybindings and
shortcuts that make vim an incredibly powerful tool. These key-bindings are so
useful that they have been integrated into many text-editors or IDEs. As a
result, even if you won’t use vim from the terminal, you can often use its
vim-keybindings from within other programming tools. For instance, if you are a
data scientist and enjoy using R-Studio, you can activate vim-keybindings from
within R-Studio. I myself use vim within Atom, which is just another IDE. Thus,
whenever I talk about vim, I am not strictly referring to the terminal-based
text editor but actually to vim-keybindings.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-1"></span>
<img src="/img/gallery_vim/Vimlogo.svg" alt="The vim logo" width="25%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>By now you are probably quite confused about these mysterious vim-keybindings,
so let me try to explain what they’re good for. For this, let’s quickly think
about the way in which we humans interact with a computer. Most of us are used
to operate our computers using a combination of mouse and keyboard. This duality
allows a rather intuitive navigation, yet also requires that one of our hands
constantly switches between mouse and keyboard. This process of switching back
and forth is rather time-consuming and particularly inefficient when writing
code, as this often involves moving, copying, appending, and deleting blocks of
code as well as scrolling up or down in the script.</p>
<p>The way in which vim operates is slightly different from what you’re used to.
Vim basically turns your keyboard into a multi-mode keyboard, where each mode
has a distinct purpose. For now, we only care about two modes: <em>normal</em> mode and
<em>insert</em> mode. The normal mode serves to replace your mouse and allows you to
<em>navigate</em> across your document using dedicated keys. The insert mode, on the
other hand, serves as your usual keyboard and allows you to <em>insert text</em>.
Hence, when using vim, you’ll be constantly switching between normal mode and
insert mode. This allows you to get rid of the mouse, by simply turning your
keyboard into a navigation instrument. While this sounds awefully complicated,
it also enables you to always rest your palms on the keyboard. Aside from
enabling navigation such as moving up, down, left, and right, vim comes with
many more useful keybindings that implement the most common tasks, such as to
copy and paste text, to search for words, to undo your actions and so on. Of
course you can substitute many of these with every day keyboard commands (e.g.
ctrl + c, ctrl + v), yet you will never achieve the same efficiency as with vim.
If you still don’t believe that vim is awesome, let me drive home the point
using an example. Assume you want to copy an entire line of code and paste it to
the line below. Let’s also assume that the cursor is already on the line you’d
like to copy. If you don’t know about vim, you will likely….</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Move your right hand from the keyboard to the mouse</li>
<li>Move the cursor to the beginning of the line you want to copy</li>
<li>Click and drag the cursor along the line and highlight the text</li>
<li>Use <code>ctrl + c</code> to copy the line</li>
<li>Move the cursor one line below (maybe you feel fancy and use the arrow keys)</li>
<li>Use <code>ctrl + v</code> to paste the line</li>
<li>Move your hand back to the keyboard</li>
</ol>
<p>done…</p>
<p>If you know how to use vim, you simply ensure that the keyboard is in
<em>navigation</em> mode and…</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>press <code>y</code> (yank)</li>
<li>press <code>y</code> (yank)</li>
<li>press <code>p</code> (paste)</li>
</ol>
<p>done…</p>
<p>I guess it’s clear that the latter approach is light-years quicker, much
cleaner, and more precise. Once you truly master vim, such improvements will pay
off and you will be able to navigate and manipulate your document much faster,
without ever having to move your mouse. Having said that, it’s also important to
realize that there is a very steep initial learning curve. At times, learning
vim can be incredibly frustrating. However, keep going and don’t get
discouraged! Once your muscle memory kicks in and vim becomes a habit, you’re
fingers will fly over the keyboard and you’ll be pumping out code in matters of
seconds. Eventually, you’ll getget the hang of it and never want to let go of
vim. In my case, it took at least a month of until I was able to use vim
sensibly. Today, I use vim for everything I do. In fact, I feel handicapped when
I can’t use it! So let’s get into it and see how it works.</p>
</div>
<div id="installation" class="section level1">
<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>Although many IDEs have the ability to enable vim keybindings, I would recommend
that you first get familiar with vim by using it through the terminal. The
reason for this is that not all IDEs make use of the same available keybindings.
Thus, to avoid confusion, its best to start with regular vim. Anyways, if you
want to use vim through the terminal, you obviously need to have it installed.
You can check if vim is already installed on your system by opening a terminal
and typing the command “vim”. If this opens up vim you’re good to go. Otherwise,
you need install vim manually by following <a href="%22https://www.vim.org/download.php%22">these
instructions</a>. Once that’s done, you’re
ready to take off. Open your terminal and enter vim.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/gallery_vim/opening_vim.gif" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Opening vim from the command line should look like this (except for the german language maybe)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="how-to-use-vim" class="section level1">
<h1>How to use VIM</h1>
<p>To get acquainted with vim, I would highly recommend that you to work through
the “vimtutor”. The vimtutor is a great little tutorial that comes preinstalled
with vim and will teach you all the basics of vim. You can invoke the tutor by
opening a terminal and typing “vimtutor”. If you’re too lazy to work through the
tutor, don’t worry, I’ll now go over the very basics of vim with you.</p>
<div id="closing-vim" class="section level2">
<h2>Closing Vim</h2>
<p>Closing a program shouldn’t be too difficult, right? Truth is, there are tons of
memes making fun of people who fail to close vim. So let’s get that out of the
way. Once you successfully opened vim, you can close it by typing <code>:q!</code> and
hitting enter. <code>:q!</code> is not some weird looking emoji but a “chain” of commands:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="5%" />
<col width="94%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Command</th>
<th align="left">Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>:</code></td>
<td align="left">Open the vim-terminal (sometimes also called command mode)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>q</code></td>
<td align="left">Close vim</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>!</code></td>
<td align="left"><em>Optional</em>: enforce the above command, even if there are unsaved changes in the document</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Consequently, running this command should close vim and bring you back to the
regular terminal. If this is was the case, open up vim again by typing vim in
the terminal.</p>

<div id="switching-keyboard-modes" class="section level2">
<h2>Switching Keyboard Modes</h2>
<p>Now that we taught those nasty memes a lesson, we can move on to more
sophisticated stuff. First of all, you need to learn how to switch between
normal (i.e. navigation) and insert mode. Remember, normal mode is used to
navigate, insert mode to … well … insert stuff. When you fire up vim, you’ll
jump into normal by default. This often causes confusion when people start
typing on their keyboard but instead of writing text they erratically move
across the document. Thus, before you can type, you need to switch into insert
mode. This is achieved by pressing <code>i</code>. Once you’re in insert mode, you can use
the keyboard as usual and write out some text. Once you’re done, hit the <code>Esc</code>
key to return into normal mode. Well done! You now know how to switch between
insert and normal mode.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Command</th>
<th align="left">Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>i</code></td>
<td align="left">Switch to <em>insert</em> mode</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>Esc</code></td>
<td align="left">Switch to <em>normal</em> (i.e. navigation) mode</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Try switching between the two modes a couple of times and see if you can note a
difference. You’ll notice that the visual difference is pretty underwhelming.
Only in the bottom left corner a small indicator tells you whether you’re in
insert mode or not. It appears that vim was already minimalist before it was
cool. If you’re ever uncertain whether you are currently in normal or insert
model, simply hit Esc multiple times (I typically hit like a maniac…) just to
be sure that you’re in normal mode.</p>
</div>
<div id="undo-redo" class="section level2">
<h2>Undo &amp; Redo</h2>
<p>When you switch from insert to normal mode, all of your modifications done
during insert mode will be “logged”. That is, everytime you leave insert mode by
hitting <code>Esc</code>, you create a “timestamp”. You can move backward (undo) or forward
(redo) between those timestamps using <code>u</code> and <code>ctrl + r</code>, respectively.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Command</th>
<th align="left">Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>u</code></td>
<td align="left">undo (move one timestamp backward)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>ctrl + r</code></td>
<td align="left">redo (move one timestamp forward)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div id="navigation" class="section level2">
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>If you already feel like vim is a pain in the bottom, you should probably stop
reading. We are now going to learn how to navigate around in a document using
vim. Navigation in vim is achieved using tons of shortcuts. But don’t worry,
most of them make sense and are easy to remember and soon you’ll drop them smoother
than Bhusta Rhymes raps. The most important navigation keys to remember are <code>h</code>
<code>j</code> <code>k</code> and <code>l</code>. These are the keys that will replace your arrow keys and are
used as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Command</th>
<th align="left">Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>h</code></td>
<td align="left">move one character backward</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>j</code></td>
<td align="left">move one line down</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>k</code></td>
<td align="left">move one line up</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>l</code></td>
<td align="left">move one character forward</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You may wonder “why the hell would I not use my arrow keys but h, j, k, and l
instead?”. The reason is that, in contrast to the arrow keys, <code>h</code> <code>j</code> <code>k</code> and
<code>l</code> are located very closely to where your fingers rest by default (at least if
you make use of the glorious 10-finger system). For this reason, you barely need
to move your hands when navigating using <code>h</code> <code>j</code> <code>k</code> and <code>l</code>. Try it out and
move around your vim document with those keys. If you accidentally switch into
insert mode, hit <code>Esc</code> to return. Once you feel comfortable using the navigation
keys, try to combine what you have learned thusfar and insert some text
somewhere. You will probably notice that <code>h</code> <code>j</code> <code>k</code> and <code>l</code> are terribly
inefficient for skipping multiple lines or characters. But don’t worry, we will
soon learn some more efficient alternatives for this.</p>
</div>
<div id="insert-and-append" class="section level2">
<h2>Insert and Append</h2>
<p>Whenever you hit <code>i</code>, vim will enter into insert mode <strong>before</strong> your cursor.
This is sometimes not really what you want, as you’d rather “append” some text
at the current location. In that case, there is an alternative. From normal
mode, type <code>a</code>. This will enter insert mode after the cursor! Noice, this means
that depending on our needs, we can jump into insert mode before or after the
cursor’s current position. In fact, there are even more options. You can also
use capital I and capital A to insert text at the beginning of the current line,
or to append text at the end of the current line. I use these commands all the
time, particularly when writing code!</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Command</th>
<th align="left">Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>i</code></td>
<td align="left">insert before cursor</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>a</code></td>
<td align="left">insert after cursor</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>I</code></td>
<td align="left">instert at the beginning of the current line</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>A</code></td>
<td align="left">instert at the end of the current line</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You will probably realize the pseudo-logic behind these commands. Capital
letters are somewhat the “big brothers” and exaggerate what the small letters
do. Kind of makes sense… doesn’t it?</p>
</div>
<div id="delete-copy-and-paste" class="section level2">
<h2>Delete, Copy and Paste</h2>
<p>By now, you have probably entered a lot of gibberish that you want to get rid
of. In some cases, you can undo your sins using the <code>u</code> command. In other cases,
you need to delete specific characters. Of course you could go into insert mode
and delete whatever you wanted. However, insert mode carries its name for a
reason and is not really designed for deletions. In vim, you delete stuff in
normal mode. For this, simply navigate to the desired location and use <code>x</code>
(exterminate) to delete what’s below the cursor. Alternatively, use <code>X</code> to
delete what’s before the cursor. Easy!</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="left">Command</th>
<th align="left">Meaning</th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="left"><code>x</code></td>
<td align="left">delete after cursor</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left"><code>X</code></td>
<td align="left">delete before cursor</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that vim stores whatever you just deleted last in a buffer. As such, you
can paste your last deletion somewhere else using <code>p</code> (paste after the cursor),
or <code>P</code> (paste before the cursor).</p>
