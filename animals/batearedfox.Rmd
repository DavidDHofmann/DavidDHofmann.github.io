The bat-eared fox (*Otocyon megalotis*) is a medium-sized canid that calls
sub-Saharan Africa its home. Adult individuals typically weigh less than 6 kg
and measure between 70 and 90 cm from nose to tail. Within the canid family,
the bat-eared fox stands alone as the sole representative of the genus
*Otocyon*. Its closest relatives include domestic dogs, wolves and foxes.
Thanks to its eponymous and extraordinary set of ears, however, the bat-eared
fox cannot be mistaken for any other species (Figure 1).

Besides its distinctive appearance, the bat-eared fox stands out in the canid
world due to its dietary preferences. As a myrmecophagus species, the bat-eared
fox primarily subsides on ants and termites. Remarkably, approximately 90% of
its diet consists of harvester termites (hodotermitidae). Equipped with
radar-like ears, *Otocyon m.* possesses an exceptional sense of hearing,
allowing it to efficiently locate insects both on the ground and beneath the
soil, thus facilitating access to food. These remarkable ears serve not only as
tools for securing sustenance but also as a means of thermoregulation. While
its ears range among the largest relative to body size (only surpassed by the
Fennec, *Vulpes zerda*), the bat-eared fox also has the dubious honor of
exhibiting the smallest relative brain size among its kin. Nevertheless,
scientific experiments have uncovered an impressive capacity for
problem-solving and innovation in this species [@Petelle.2023].

Bat-eared foxes inhabit two distinct regions within the sub-Saharan landscape:
one in the North-East, encompassing Tanzania, Kenya, and Ethiopia, and the
other in the South-West, mainly including Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa
(as shown in Figure 2). Intriguingly, these ranges closely align with the
distribution of harvester termites, underscoring the species' strong reliance
on this food source [@Koop.1982; @Malcom.1986]. As a result, the species' range
also overlaps with that of other myrmecophagus species, such as the aardvark
(*Orycteropus afer*), aardwolf (*Proteles cristatus*), and Temminck's pangoling
(*Smutsia temminckii*) [@Pietersen.2023].

```{r, echo=F, messages=F, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Distribution of the bat-eared fox across sub-Saharan Africa. The species occupies two distinct ranges, on in North-Eastern Africa, another one in South-Western Africa (resulting in the two subspecies *megalotis* and *virgatus*). Notably, these ranges coincide with the spatial distribution of harvester termites (hodotermitidae), which constitute the bat-eared foxes' primary source of food."}

Within the two ranges, the bat-eared fox prefers short-grassed Savannah habitat
and can often be found frisking around in front of their burrows at dawn and
dusk [@Malcom.1986]. These creatures are active both day and night, their
activity patterns dependent on insect availability. At Nxai Pan in Botswana,
where insects are most abundant around noon, bat-eared foxes tend to be
diurnal, while in most other regions, they are primarily nocturnal
[@Koop.1982]. During periods of inactivity, they retreat to their burrows for
rest.

Bat-eared foxes live in monogamous bonds that last for a lifetime. Pairs with
offspring are called families and may consist of up to 15 individuals, yet on
average contain 3 to 4 individuals. Pups are born after a gestation period of
60 to 70 days, the timing of which synchronizes with the season of peak insect
abundance, thus ensuring a readily available food source for the newborns.
Impressively, the species displays a high degree of tolerance towards other
families, often allowing them to share feeding areas without territorial
disputes [@Koop.1982; @Malcom.1986]. The size of a family's home-range varies
greatly based on food availability, spanning from 0.3 to 3.5 kmÂ²
[@Malcom.1986].

Bat-eared foxes rarely survive past an age of 9 years, with their primary cause
of mortality being predation by other carnivores. Natural predators include
lions (*Panthera leo*), cheetahs (*Acinonyx jubatus*), leopards (*Panthera
pardus*), spotted hyenas (*Crocuta crocuta*), African wild dogs (*Lycaon
pictus*), and black-backed jackals (*Lupulella mesomelas*). Although bat-eared
foxes may occasionally display acts of bravery, charging and lunging at jackals
or hyenas to protect their burrows, they often retract at the last moment,
avoiding actual combat [@Emmet.2018].

Interestingly, there's a documented instance from Hwange National Park in
Zimbabwe where a pack of African wild dogs began specializing in hunting
bat-eared foxes [@Rasmussen.1996]. This unexpected specialization occurred
after the dominant female of the pack passed away, causing the pack to adapt to
a different prey source. Intriguingly, this specialization reached a level
where impalas, wild dog's primary source of prey in the area, no longer
perceived them as a threat, knowing they were specialized on another species.

The [International Union for Conservation of Nature
(IUCN)](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/15642/46123809) currently
classifies the bat-eared fox as a species of "least concern", suggesting that,
for the time being, these unique canids face no immediate threats to their
survival.
